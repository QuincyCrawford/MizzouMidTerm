### **SO!** you wanna know about my family and home huh? 

##### well why dont we start with my home town: 

I was born and raised in a "_city_" called Clinton Missouri. You maybe wondering why I italiciced _City_. Well that would be because for a city Clinton is pretty small only around 9000 people, and well frankly outside of hunting, fishing, andmajor events in my town such as holidays or old glory days -which is our 4th of july festival- there really is not anything to do and nothing spectacular to draw anyones eye. its just a run of the mill quiet little town that we call a city. if by some weird reason you want to learn more about my humble home...
