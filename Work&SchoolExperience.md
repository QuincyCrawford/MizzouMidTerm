### Hmmm this seems like the _boring..._ option but alright lets talk about SCHOOL & WORK
Also fair warning this page is gonna be _longggggg_

##### well obviously I am currently attending Mizzou:
Well what am I doing here. well currently I am participaing in multiple rec intramurals such as football and dodgeball. I am also In Mizzou Space Program building a space baloon and will eventually building certification grade **Whole rockets**. I am attend RHA meetings to help my resident hall thrive. And currently I am taking Japanese, English 1000, IT 1000 (intro to IT), IT 1040 (Python Programming). I feel like I also should add that I **LOVE** it here

 In my IT classes I am doing alot of learning programming which I have very little prior experience in and devloped my skills from a code block like this a 2 print commands that simply output what
 ```
 def main():
    print("HelloWorld")
    print("My name is Quincy")
main()
```
To knowing more advanced code such as this assignment where I had to make a code that reads numbers from a list and can tell you information about the list that you ask for which may not seem that impressive but it is a large improvement that I am proud of

```
filename = input('Enter the name of the file: you wish to use (numbers 2.txt)')
print("")

def main_list():

   try:
       infile = open(filename, 'r')
       count = 0
       total = 0.0
       average = 0.0
       maximum = 0
       minimum = 0
       range1 = 0

       for line in infile:
           num = int(line)
           count = count + 1
           total = total + num
           if count == 1:
               maximum = num
               minimum = num
           else:
               if num > maximum:
                   maximum = num
               if num < minimum:
                   minimum = num
       if count > 0:
           average = total / count
           range1 = maximum - minimum

       dict = {1: filename, 2: total, 3: count, 4: average, 5: maximum, 6: minimum, 7:range1}

       print("what would you like to know about the file")
       print("")
       print("to repeat the file name type: filename")
       print("to see the sum/total type: sum1")
       print("to see how many numbers are in the file type: count")
       print("to see the average of all the numbers type: avg")
       print("to see the biggest number type: max")
       print("to see the smallest number type: min")
       print("to see the range type: ran")
       print("")
       user_input = input("what is your choice")
       while (True):
           try:
       
               if user_input == 'filename':
                   print(f"the name of the file is",dict[1])
                   print("")
                   print("if you would like to know something else please run the program again and input what you would like to know")
                   break
               elif user_input =='sum1':
                   print(f"the sum of the numbers in the file is",dict[2])
                   print("")
                   print("if you would like to know something else please run the program again and input what you would like to know")
                   break

                   break

       infile.close()

   except:

       print('The input file is not found! Please check the file name and try again')

main_list()

```

also I learned how to use all of this Markdown like how I can Pull pictures from this  github repository

and this one from another website called picsum

All and all of that I am pretty Proud of my Progress

##### AND FINALLY my current work experience

I did farm hand work for an elderly couple as my first summer job, I worked with live stock and farm vehicles, pulled weeds and basically what you would expect me to do

I also am have been a lifeguard and aquatic manager for my home town parks and recreation for the past three years. I am water rescue and CPR certified through the american red cross

I worked a internsip for a buisness called transcontinental capri as a IT technician.
I installed software, managed user permissions, worked on servers, took inventory, built/recycled computers and setups, etc. I did this for almost a year before I had to end my internship to go to Mizzou
